We&#8217;ve been working long and hard to bring you this release, and I hope you enjoy using it as   much as we&#8217;e enjoyed working on it. In this release we&#8217;ve focused a tremendous amount on what   we believe to be the core of blogging &#8212; the writing interface.  Before you upgrade from an earlier version, remember that this is a major release and   thousands of lines of code have changed. Before upgrading it&#8217;s always good, <em>just in   case</em>, to make a backup of your database and WordPress files. It only takes a few minutes   and gives you a total safety net if for whatever reason things don&#8217;t work. It is also probably   a good idea to turn off your plugins, and activate them one-by-one after you&#8217;ve upgraded.   Without further ado, you can <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">download WordPress 2   right now</a>. Read on for more information about what we think you&#8217;ll love about Duke.</p>\n<p><a id="more-177"></a></p>\n<h3>User Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Completely Redesigned Backend</strong> &#8212; The first thing you&#8217;ll notice when you login to your   blog is the backend has been completely overhauled for both aesthetics and usability. This is   the first iteration of exciting things to come from the Shuttle team of designers that has   been volunteering their time, and look for even more aesthetic improvements in the   future.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Administration</strong> &#8212; Call it AJAX, call it DHTML, call it Larry, but we&#8217;ve paid close   attention to streamlining some of the most common tasks in managing your blog. For example if   you&#8217;re writing a post and you can add categories on the fly, much like tagging in Flickr. Also   instead of having two separate UIs for &#8220;simple&#8221; and &#8220;advanced&#8221; posting, we&#8217;ve combined them   and let you customize the layout of the page on the fly by dragging and dropping the dialogs   around. It saves where you put things so when you return it&#8217;s just like you left it. When you   delete a comment or category it will fade out without a page load.</li>\n<li><strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong> &#8212; WP dev Andy Skelton and the TinyMCE team have done a tremendous amount   of work to bring a smooth WYSIWYG editing experience to WordPress. As code purists, we are   very picky about what kind of HTML is generated, and while it&#8217;s not perfect yet (for instance   nested lists can cause trouble) for 95% of what you do post-to-post the WYSIWYG should save   you time. And if it doesn&#8217;t, you can turn it off on your profile page. One note: Safari and   older versions of Opera, both fantastic browsers, don&#8217;t yet support everything that&#8217;s needed   to do WYSIWYG, but we fully expect new versions of those browsers will continue to improve   their standards support, so it may just be a matter of time.</li>\n<li><strong>Included Spam and Backup Plugins</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve included two of the most popular WordPress   plugins: Skippy&#8217;s DB backup can backup your database to a file and optionally email you a   copy; Akismet is a distributed anti-spam system which gets smarter the more people use   it.</li>\n<li><strong>Resizable Editing</strong> &#8212; This is one of my personal favorite features. Ever been writing a   post and that textarea seemed a little small? Happens to me all the time, and our new rich   text editor includes a feature that lets you resize the editor on-the-fly by clicking on the   corner, just like a regular window.</li>\n<li><strong>Inline Uploading</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve optimized our uploader for image, audio, and video files and   put it inline with the posting screen. You don&#8217;t have to bounce around any more when writing a   post! It also will organize your files for you as you upload them to make them easier to find   later. On the backend, each uploaded file is actually a &#8220;sub-post&#8221; so it can have individual   comments and pingbacks, its own permalink, and even a custom template based on what type of   file it is. You can click on attached files to get a menu of options, or if you&#8217;re on Firefox   you can drag and drop them into your WYSIWYG editor.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster Posting</strong> &#8212; In the past if you were linking to a number of posts or pinging a lot   of update services, your posting time could appear to slow to a crawl even though everything   was instantly done on the backend. We&#8217;ve modified how this works now so posting should be   near-instantaneous, like everything else in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Preview</strong> &#8212; Another enhancement to the post screen, now when you save a post it shows   a live preview of how the post would look on your site, with the stylesheet and theme and   everything. No more publishing a post just to see if it works.</li>\n<li><strong>Streamlined Importing</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve rewritten our import system from the ground up to be much   easier to use (you no longer have to edit files), put it behind authentication, and also made   it easy for new importers to be dropped into the system, much like plugins.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles</strong> &#8212; We had a ton of feedback on our old numerical user level system. No one was   exactly sure what those numbers meant! We&#8217;ve distilled the basic functions into a set of roles   &#8212; such as administrator, editor, contributor &#8212; that make it easier to understand what sort   of capabilities you&#8217;re giving your blog&#8217;s users. The new system is completely pluggable too,   so plugins can modify roles and create groups that have access to certain things.</li>\n<li><strong>Header Customization</strong> &#8212; If you&#8217;re tired of the blue header in the default theme, you can   now change the colors and text of it, which we&#8217;ve included as a demo of some of the new   features available to theme authors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Developer Features</h3>\n<p>On the backend we&#8217;ve done a ton of changes to clean up code, make things more consistent, and   enable a lot of new types of applications to be built on top of WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>User Level Options</strong> &#8212; You can now store options on a <em>per-user</em> level rather than   having them apply for the entire blog. An example of this in WP2 is with the rich text editor,   which can be turned on or off per a user&#8217;s discretion.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Abstraction</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve eliminated almost all direct SQL queries from the code and   moved them to functions and classes that make the entire program more consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Caching</strong> &#8212; WordPress now includes a completely pluggable object cache system   that cuts the number of queries most pages do in half. By default it is disk-based, but there   is already a plugin to use memcached and we expect more are on their way. We&#8217;ve only begun to   tap into this.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugin Hooks Galore</strong> &#8212; We&#8217;ve added hooks for plugin authors wherever we could think to,   so what you&#8217;re able to do in the new system is pretty dramatic. Ne features like the WYSIWYG   and the inline uploader are completely pluggable and can be replaced entirely.</li>\n<li><strong>Import Framework</strong> &#8212; The new import framework allows you to create an importer with about   a third of the code you used to need, and it can have a consistent interface with no extra   work.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Functions</strong> &#8212; Themes can now include a functions.php file that will now be loaded   like a plugin attached to the theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme preview images</strong> &#8212; You can now include a screenshot of the theme with the download   so in the WP interface your users will see a quick preview of what it looks like.</li>\n<li><strong>Hundreds and Hundreds of Bug Fixes</strong> &#8212; <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/milestone/2.0">2.0 has hundreds of tracked bugs and   enhancements</a>, many that are very subtle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You may have noticed our design has changed quite a bit.

But what is all this <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-January/004066.html">talk about removing feeds</a> from our favorite blogging tool?  Let&#8217;s have a rational look&#8230;</p>\n<p>WordPress currently supports four standard feed formats for syndication: RSS 0.92, RSS 1.0 (aka RDF), RSS 2.0 (aka RSS2), and Atom 0.3.  All of these feeds are at least vague implementations of XML, and allow applications (feed aggregators) to gather data about your posts without actually visiting your site.  This can be done because these formats are machine-readable - that is, a computer/server can be configured to automatically visit your feed and parse out the data that it provides into usable chunks.</p>\n<p>There are certain problems with the feeds that WordPress provides, and whether these really are problems depends on your perspective.  But let me tell you what I see from a coder&#8217;s point of view, and why you should consider listening to my argument.<br />\n<a id="more-2216"></a><br />\nEach of the feeds that WordPress provides is supplied by a distinctly separate script.  Essentially, the inner workings of WordPress churn on each request and regurgitate a raw spew of data representing the last few posts that you&#8217;ve written.  Then the script that you&#8217;ve requested - be it RSS, RDF, or Atom - figures out how to format that raw data into something that looks like a feed.</p>\n<p>At it&#8217;s core, the problem is that these files are not easily maintained because they are separate.  Why is this?</p>\n<p>Every time you want to add functionality, like using a true GUID (Globally Unique ID - An identifier that is unique for each post in a feed), you need to change not just one file, but four.</p>\n<p>When WordPress 2.0 was released, the approved/standard method of looping through each post was augmented.  As such, all four feeds should have been updated with this new method to ensure that they are up to date.  Were they all updated?  No.</p>\n<p>In fact, it has been a month since the last update to any of the feeds, in which a small glitch with a GUID was updated.  (It was updated in other feeds, but not the one that was missed.) Before that, none of the feed scripts had been updated for <em>four months</em>.  Surely software that has seen a major revision in that time should have had some review in this area.  Maybe it was perfect.  I&#8217;m not sure, but that seems strange to me.</p>\n<p>People have said that RDF and RSS 0.92 are &#8220;simply too old&#8221;, and maybe that&#8217;s not fair.  Some formats are being actively developed, but since our little blog software development world doesn&#8217;t seem to keep up with those innovations, we don&#8217;t see any benefit.  Some folks would like to see Atom support upgraded from 0.3 to 1.0, and I am among them.  It seems a disservice to WordPress to allow these feed formats to languish in disrepair, whether they are superceded by newer formats or not.</p>\n<p>A seemingly separate issue:  A suggestion that I agreed with on the wp-hackers mailing list earlier this month was additional support for comment metadata, including transferring comment handling into a centralized API.  Currently, if you want to access comment information from inside plugin code, there isn&#8217;t an efficient method to get it apart from requesting it directly from the database.  As a result, no filters can be applied to that information, and none of the information comes out of any cache, so it&#8217;s very difficult to write good, efficient plugins that affect comments.</p>\n<p>Likewise, dealing with categories directly is a programmatic problem.  Sure, you can do it, but it involves an arcane process that is best not attempted by any but veteran plugin developers.  Function accessors to this data would prove an immense improvement for plugin development, if not for general overall efficiency and readability.</p>\n<p>Making these changes is a good idea, but would affect large sections of code.  It&#8217;s not something that would happen overnight.  It could not be planned for the upcoming 2.0.1 service release, and I only suggested it as a future enhancement.  Nonetheless, feeds may be significantly affected by these changes.</p>\n<p>Changes in significant areas of the software such as these would require exponentially significant testing.  And as might have been noticed during our pains from the 2.0 release, WordPress could stand to have a bit more thorough testing generally.  It doesn&#8217;t need the strain of testing on formats that we don&#8217;t even have an developer advocate strong enough to volunteer for coding and testing.  Not only would someone have to adopt each of the four feed files, but we would need testers to focus on the changes in those areas.  I don&#8217;t see enough people who care - Maybe you&#8217;re out there?</p>\n<p>In that vein, the suggestion was proffered that to reduce some of the development load we should retire some of the feed formats that aren&#8217;t as well used.  That way, we can concentrate on perfecting the feeds that we do offer, improving the architecture in general, and opening up development to others who could supply their own feed formats.  Sure, we who agreed this was a good idea were looking at the feeds as a method for a site owner to syndicate his site - not as a way for services to scrape data from your blogs.</p>\n<p>One of the main complaints that I&#8217;ve heard is that removing RDF would cripple services that rely on the data it provides; that RDF is somehow more data-packed than the other formats available in a base install.  I&#8217;m not sure how this is possible considering that they all are served the same data, but that&#8217;s irrelevant.</p>\n<p>WordPress is at its core <em><strong>blogging software</strong></em>.  It&#8217;s target user is a <em>blogger</em>.  Do most bloggers know that they&#8217;re publishing their data in feeds that are being scraped by services who would be mad if those feeds were suddenly cut off?  I&#8217;m not sure what service <em>requires</em> one of the feed formats we&#8217;re suggesting for retirement; one that can&#8217;t use one of the other formats.  And as a blogger, are you really concerned about <a href="http://www.planetrdf.com/">those services that you didn&#8217;t even know existed</a>?  I, for one, am unnerved that my data would be used that way, and look forward to turning RDF off on principle.</p>\n<p>Besides that, nobody is suggesting that WordPress be restricted from producing RDF or any other of the feed types.  It is good design to consolidate the method of producing feeds to reduce the overall code size, but that implies better, more flexible architecture.  A new architecture would allow the production of additional <em>even more robust</em> feeds that the current architecture doesn&#8217;t support; something that we could do via plugin that we would have a hard time doing now.  And certainly, just as with the geographic coordinate funtionality that was removed from WordPress 1.2 for 1.5, a plugin would be available upon release to reinstitute those feeds for those who wanted to keep them.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say essentially, &#8220;It ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221;  Maybe not, but if we don&#8217;t fix it when we update other parts of WordPress, then it surely <em>will</em> break.  Let&#8217;s fix it right and plan ahead to make it better instead of patching it all up piecemeal.</p>\n<p>And as far as <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/01/17/wordpress-and-rss-10/">bogus theats</a> of the Semantic Web people skipping out on WordPress for omitting a feed format are concerned, I can&#8217;t believe that anyone could find as flexible a product for producing the needed feeds as WordPress, even if WordPress had never produced RDF.  (Hey, isn&#8217;t Semantic Web a pipe dream anyway?)</p>\n<p>So where does that leave us?  Lesser-used feeds should be retired from WordPress to benefit development of the feeds we keep and the coverage of code that needs testing.  Having core code that <em>all</em> works is more important than making sure any pet formats are included.</p>\n<p>In the end, we&#8217;ve only heard the word of one of the Automattic guys on the issue, and <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-January/004091.html">he&#8217;s not too enthusiastic about it</a>.  I&#8217;ve learned that in order to get anything major done in WordPress you need two things: Running code and commit dev support.  We &#8220;anti-RDF&#8221; people have neither so far, but we&#8217;re still talking about a solution that works best for everyone.  So let&#8217;s not all panic.</p>\n<p>It sure would be helpful if people who care <em>about</em> these formats would step out and <em>take</em> care of them, though.\n</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/asymptomatic/wp?g=1" />";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 22 Jan 2006 22:30:20 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Owen";}s:7:"summary";s:9178:"<p>Let&#8217;s do away with the doom and gloom: In spite of <a href="http://captsolo.net/info/blog_a.php/2006/01/16/wordpress_to_drop_rdf_rss_1_0">recent context-deprived accounts</a>, WordPress isn&#8217;t anywhere near ditching any of its feed formats.

Some formats are being actively developed, but since our little blog software development world doesn&#8217;t seem to keep up with those innovations, we don&#8217;t see any benefit.  Some folks would like to see Atom support upgraded from 0.3 to 1.0, and I am among them.  It seems a disservice to WordPress to allow these feed formats to languish in disrepair, whether they are superceded by newer formats or not.</p>\n<p>A seemingly separate issue:  A suggestion that I agreed with on the wp-hackers mailing list earlier this month was additional support for comment metadata, including transferring comment handling into a centralized API.  Currently, if you want to access comment information from inside plugin code, there isn&#8217;t an efficient method to get it apart from requesting it directly from the database.  As a result, no filters can be applied to that information, and none of the information comes out of any cache, so it&#8217;s very difficult to write good, efficient plugins that affect comments.</p>\n<p>Likewise, dealing with categories directly is a programmatic problem.  Sure, you can do it, but it involves an arcane process that is best not attempted by any but veteran plugin developers.  Function accessors to this data would prove an immense improvement for plugin development, if not for general overall efficiency and readability.</p>\n<p>Making these changes is a good idea, but would affect large sections of code.  It&#8217;s not something that would happen overnight.  It could not be planned for the upcoming 2.0.1 service release, and I only suggested it as a future enhancement.  Nonetheless, feeds may be significantly affected by these changes.</p>\n<p>Changes in significant areas of the software such as these would require exponentially significant testing.  And as might have been noticed during our pains from the 2.0 release, WordPress could stand to have a bit more thorough testing generally.  It doesn&#8217;t need the strain of testing on formats that we don&#8217;t even have an developer advocate strong enough to volunteer for coding and testing.  Not only would someone have to adopt each of the four feed files, but we would need testers to focus on the changes in those areas.  I don&#8217;t see enough people who care - Maybe you&#8217;re out there?</p>\n<p>In that vein, the suggestion was proffered that to reduce some of the development load we should retire some of the feed formats that aren&#8217;t as well used.  That way, we can concentrate on perfecting the feeds that we do offer, improving the architecture in general, and opening up development to others who could supply their own feed formats.  Sure, we who agreed this was a good idea were looking at the feeds as a method for a site owner to syndicate his site - not as a way for services to scrape data from your blogs.</p>\n<p>One of the main complaints that I&#8217;ve heard is that removing RDF would cripple services that rely on the data it provides; that RDF is somehow more data-packed than the other formats available in a base install.  I&#8217;m not sure how this is possible considering that they all are served the same data, but that&#8217;s irrelevant.</p>\n<p>WordPress is at its core <em><strong>blogging software</strong></em>.  It&#8217;s target user is a <em>blogger</em>.  Do most bloggers know that they&#8217;re publishing their data in feeds that are being scraped by services who would be mad if those feeds were suddenly cut off?  I&#8217;m not sure what service <em>requires</em> one of the feed formats we&#8217;re suggesting for retirement; one that can&#8217;t use one of the other formats.  And as a blogger, are you really concerned about <a href="http://www.planetrdf.com/">those services that you didn&#8217;t even know existed</a>?  I, for one, am unnerved that my data would be used that way, and look forward to turning RDF off on principle.</p>\n<p>Besides that, nobody is suggesting that WordPress be restricted from producing RDF or any other of the feed types.  It is good design to consolidate the method of producing feeds to reduce the overall code size, but that implies better, more flexible architecture.  A new architecture would allow the production of additional <em>even more robust</em> feeds that the current architecture doesn&#8217;t support; something that we could do via plugin that we would have a hard time doing now.  And certainly, just as with the geographic coordinate funtionality that was removed from WordPress 1.2 for 1.5, a plugin would be available upon release to reinstitute those feeds for those who wanted to keep them.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say essentially, &#8220;It ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it.&#8221;  Maybe not, but if we don&#8217;t fix it when we update other parts of WordPress, then it surely <em>will</em> break.  Let&#8217;s fix it right and plan ahead to make it better instead of patching it all up piecemeal.</p>\n<p>And as far as <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/01/17/wordpress-and-rss-10/">bogus theats</a> of the Semantic Web people skipping out on WordPress for omitting a feed format are concerned, I can&#8217;t believe that anyone could find as flexible a product for producing the needed feeds as WordPress, even if WordPress had never produced RDF.  (Hey, isn&#8217;t Semantic Web a pipe dream anyway?)</p>\n<p>So where does that leave us?  Lesser-used feeds should be retired from WordPress to benefit development of the feeds we keep and the coverage of code that needs testing.  Having core code that <em>all</em> works is more important than making sure any pet formats are included.</p>\n<p>In the end, we&#8217;ve only heard the word of one of the Automattic guys on the issue, and <a href="http://comox.textdrive.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-January/004091.html">he&#8217;s not too enthusiastic about it</a>.  I&#8217;ve learned that in order to get anything major done in WordPress you need two things: Running code and commit dev support.  We &#8220;anti-RDF&#8221; people have neither so far, but we&#8217;re still talking about a solution that works best for everyone.  So let&#8217;s not all panic.</p>\n<p>It sure would be helpful if people who care <em>about</em> these formats would step out and <em>take</em> care of them, though.\n</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/asymptomatic/wp?g=1" />";}i:13;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:31:"Owen Winkler: I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it.";s:4:"guid";s:54:"http://asymptomatic.net/2006/01/10/2206/i-didnt-do-it/";s:4:"link";s:47:"http://feeds.feedburner.com/asymptomatic/wp?m=2";s:11:"description";s:3491:"<p>In the infamous words of Bart Simpson, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what craziness is going on over at <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/Asymptomatic/planet.wordpress.org">Planet WordPress</a>, but I have done nothing to my WordPress feed since December 31st, except perhaps update the site from Subversion.

I hope that this page gets rolled into the main site soon because it&#8217;s a little off the beaten path.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the good news:  Themes are probably OK.  Unless your theme was doing something crazy before, it&#8217;s probably going to work after the upgrade.  There have been a lot of new plugin hooks added to the 2.0 version, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like anything made it into the theme system that would cause it to break.</p>\n<p>The theme system does allow for a custom plugin-like set of functions to be loaded.  WordPress will automatically load a file named functions.php for any theme that includes one.  This is done in the same way that plugins are loaded, and allows themes to supply their own custom features, including both output functions and configuration pages.</p>\n<p>Also, themes should now come with &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; images (I say &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; in quotes because they&#8217;re actually more the size of your palm, but&#8230;) that will be displayed in the admin.  If your theme doesn&#8217;t have one, it&#8217;ll simply show a blank box.</p>\n<p>A theme that doesn&#8217;t have either one of these should load just as it did in WordPress 1.5.2, but won&#8217;t have those additional features.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugins are another question, though.</strong>  There are some specific sections of WordPress that have been heavily revised.  If you use a plugin that integrates into one of these sections, it will probably not work.  Specifically, the permissions and capability sections will be a bear for plugins that are affected by user levels.</p>\n<p>If you are running a &#8220;view level&#8221; plugin - something that restricts a reader&#8217;s permissions to access certain posts - I&#8217;ll say straight out right now that unless you&#8217;ve got a brand new version (and I know of no author who has written one of these plugins that is offering an updated version) it&#8217;s not going to work.  If you have an update, comment here - I&#8217;m looking for it myself.</p>\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of this is that any plugin that uses an admin page will need review.  The function call that adds custom admin pages used to require a user level number.  It now requires a capability name.  Now there are some backwards-compatibility checks for user levels in there, but they may obviously not work as well as something specifically designed to work with the new capabilities system.</p>\n<p>Also in the administration area, if you are using a plugin that hooks into the editor, you may have issues with it.  This is particularly so if that plugin adds buttons to the Quicktag toolbar, since the new default is to use the WYSIWYG editor, which does not use the same toolbar.</p>\n<p>I have written the <a href="http://redalt.com/downloads/wp2/buttonsnap.zip">buttonsnap class</a>, which lets plugin authors add buttons to both editors very easily.  It&#8217;s not a plugin itself, but a library that makes it very simple for plugin authors to create buttons in either editor with a simple, single function call.  Still, the plugin will have to be rewritten to use my library or some other solution if it&#8217;s going to be effectual.</p>\n<p>If your plugins use DOM to insert new elements into the user interface (pretty much any plugin that adds elements is using DOM to do it) then it may need to be updated to account for changes there.</p>\n<p>The Upload page in the admin is gone.  If your plugin altered or attached to that page, it won&#8217;t be any more.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, you&#8217;re going to need to procure write access for your server to the /wp-content directory of WordPress.  That means you have to allow your server to write files into that directory from scripts.  This will allow things like caching, image uploading, and the bundled backup plugin to work as they should, although your host may not like it or allow it (most hosts will, but you should check), and you might not consider it secure to leave all of the subdirectories there in that state.</p>\n<p>You should verify with someone you trust concerning the permissions you intend to use to provide the access to your server that you want to provide.</p>\n<p><strong>What should you do if your plugin doesn&#8217;t work?</strong></p>\n<p>Panic.</p>\n<p>Nah, just kidding.  Actually, before you upgrade, compare the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility">list of working plugins</a> against the ones you&#8217;re using.  If your doesn&#8217;t appear in the &#8220;known working&#8221; section of list, you need to talk to someone.</p>\n<p>Your best bet, if you can find contact info, is to badger the plugin author.  Barring that, you can try any of the standard <a href="http://wordpress.org/support">support channels</a>, but be aware that in the fallout that is bound to occur when everyone upgrades, your 3rd-party code (code written by someone outside of the WordPress core) isn&#8217;t going to be a priority.</p>\n<p>I suggest trying WordPress IRC (#wordpress @ irc.freenode.net) and see if anyone there knows how to solve your problem.  There is usually someone there that can at least record the issue or forward it on to someone who can start fixing.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t been keeping up with documentation on 2.0 as well as I should, but I imagine that with the frequency of changes over the past month or two that nothing is verifiably up to date.  If you find instructions in the Codex for performing some necessary intrinsic system change, first be sure that the instructions apply to the version you are installing.</p>\n<p>Probably the most sound advice I can give you is this:  If you have any doubt about performing an upgrade - <em>don&#8217;t upgrade!</em>  There&#8217;s no reason to submit yourself as a guinea pig to test this software, especially if you&#8217;re fairly satisfied with what you have already.  Granted, WordPress 2.0 is a nice piece of work, but it&#8217;s going to be a while before 1.5.2 loses the support of the community at large.</p>\n<p>Take your time.  Learn from the mistakes of the 500,000 other downloaders.  After that, take the plunge.</p>\n<p>Remember to <em>backup everything</em>.</p>\n<p>Shameless plug: There are also people who can <a href="http://shimmerstudio.net">do your upgrade for you</a>.</p>\n<p>If any of you developers think of any other &#8220;gotchas&#8221; in the new system, please leave them in the comments.  Thanks!</p>\n<p>Otherwise, I&#8217;ll see you in WP 2.0 later this week.  I&#8217;ve got at least two plugins for 2.0 that I hope to have baked for the release.  I&#8217;m also looking forward to the sleek new <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress.org</a> <a href="http://photomatt.net/temp/wordpress-v2.png">site redesign/rebranding</a> we were promised with the new version release.\n</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/asymptomatic/wp?g=6" />";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 22 Jan 2006 22:30:20 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:4:"Owen";}s:7:"summary";s:8130:"<p>The most often asked question regarding WordPress 2.0 is, &#8220;When is it coming out?&#8221;  Well, that&#8217;s going to be <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2005/12/19/wordpress-20-release-imminent">this week</a>.</p>\n<p>The second most often asked question regarding WordPress 2.0 is, &#8220;What is changed?&#8221;  I think <a href="http://asymptomatic.net/2005/11/29/2135/whats-new-in-wordpress-20/">I wrote about that before</a>.</p>\n<p>The third most often asked question regarding WordPress 2.0 is, &#8220;Will my plugins and/or themes work?&#8221;  Uh&#8230;.  Possibly?<br />\n<a id="more-2171"></a><br />\nThis is also known as the dreaded question, &#8220;In what way is WordPress 2.0 going to break my site and cause me hours of upgrade pain without someone to whom I can whimper, &#8216;Please, make it go again.&#8217;?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This post isn&#8217;t going to make that question much easier, but I may provide a toll-free support number for handling these issues before the week is out.</p>\n<p>There is a user-supplied list of plugins that will/will not work with WordPress 2.0 over on <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/2.0_Plugin_Compatibility">photomatt&#8217;s Codex user page</a>.  I hope that this page gets rolled into the main site soon because it&#8217;s a little off the beaten path.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the good news:  Themes are probably OK.  Unless your theme was doing something crazy before, it&#8217;s probably going to work after the upgrade.  There have been a lot of new plugin hooks added to the 2.0 version, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like anything made it into the theme system that would cause it to break.</p>\n<p>The theme system does allow for a custom plugin-like set of functions to be loaded.  WordPress will automatically load a file named functions.php for any theme that includes one.  This is done in the same way that plugins are loaded, and allows themes to supply their own custom features, including both output functions and configuration pages.</p>\n<p>Also, themes should now come with &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; images (I say &#8220;thumbnail&#8221; in quotes because they&#8217;re actually more the size of your palm, but&#8230;) that will be displayed in the admin.  If your theme doesn&#8217;t have one, it&#8217;ll simply show a blank box.</p>\n<p>A theme that doesn&#8217;t have either one of these should load just as it did in WordPress 1.5.2, but won&#8217;t have those additional features.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugins are another question, though.</strong>  There are some specific sections of WordPress that have been heavily revised.  If you use a plugin that integrates into one of these sections, it will probably not work.  Specifically, the permissions and capability sections will be a bear for plugins that are affected by user levels.</p>\n<p>If you are running a &#8220;view level&#8221; plugin - something that restricts a reader&#8217;s permissions to access certain posts - I&#8217;ll say straight out right now that unless you&#8217;ve got a brand new version (and I know of no author who has written one of these plugins that is offering an updated version) it&#8217;s not going to work.  If you have an update, comment here - I&#8217;m looking for it myself.</p>\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of this is that any plugin that uses an admin page will need review.  The function call that adds custom admin pages used to require a user level number.  It now requires a capability name.  Now there are some backwards-compatibility checks for user levels in there, but they may obviously not work as well as something specifically designed to work with the new capabilities system.</p>\n<p>Also in the administration area, if you are using a plugin that hooks into the editor, you may have issues with it.  This is particularly so if that plugin adds buttons to the Quicktag toolbar, since the new default is to use the WYSIWYG editor, which does not use the same toolbar.</p>\n<p>I have written the <a href="http://redalt.com/downloads/wp2/buttonsnap.zip">buttonsnap class</a>, which lets plugin authors add buttons to both editors very easily.  It&#8217;s not a plugin itself, but a library that makes it very simple for plugin authors to create buttons in either editor with a simple, single function call.

I suppose if you&#8217;re not sure something is a bug, it might be worthwhile to ask someone else (I would ask on IRC at #wordpress on irc.freenode.net) but it really is better to have a formal record of an issue, even if it turns out that what you&#8217;re experiencing is expected behavior.  If you really fear that it&#8217;s something to do specifically with your installation, check on IRC or maybe try a fresh install.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it might be useful to folks to learn how I do it.

Here we go&#8230;<br />\n<a id="more-2142"></a></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to do to get an environment that is ripe for making source modifications:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get a WordPress.org Support Forum Login</strong> - You need a <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/register.php">support forum login</a> to gain access to Trac.  <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org">Trac</a> is the software WordPress uses for bug tracking, and it shares its login database with the support forum.</li>\n<li><strong>Download and Install Tortoise SVN</strong> - <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">Tortoise</a> is the best Subversion client for Windows.  It will let you get the latest source from the code repository without messing with funky nightly versions.</li>\n<li><strong>Install XAMPP</strong> - If you&#8217;re not already running Apache locally, you&#8217;re going to need it.  You can test under Microsoft&#8217;s IIS (and this is probably not a bad idea considering there are fewer people testing that environment) but if you&#8217;re not running Windows XP Pro (not Home), you may find this difficult.  <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html">XAMPP</a> is Apache, MySQL, PHP and some other thing you don&#8217;t need for WordPress all rolled into one bundle.</li>\n<li><strong>Checkout a Copy of WordPress</strong> - Find the directory that XAMPP is using for its DocumentRoot and right-click on it (or create a &#8220;wordpress&#8221; directory there and right-click on that).  Select <em>SVN Checkout&#8230;</em>.  In the dialog, use http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk as the repository URL.  Click OK to download the latest WordPress source.</li>\n<li><strong>Make a Database</strong> - Use phpMyAdmin to create a new database for WordPress.  Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin to see the interface.</li>\n<li><strong>Run the WordPress Install</strong> - I trust you already know how to do this.  If not, then perhaps patching is a bit advanced, no?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ok, now WordPress is running.  You should be able to do anything that you normally do with WordPress.</p>\n<p>At this point, you can modify code freely.  If you make a change you don&#8217;t like, you can always switch back to the original code.  Right-click on the file, choose <em> Tortoise SVN > Revert</em> and the file will be restored to the last checkout version.</p>\n<p>You should be able to see where you&#8217;ve made changes to the source by looking at the icon for the folder/file.  The ones that are changed will likely be red.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to do to make a patch:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Update your source</strong> - This step is pretty important, otherwise you might end up patching bugs back into source that&#8217;s already fixed.  Subversion has integrated merge features.  All you need to do is right-click on the wordpress root folder and select <em>SVN Update</em>.  If any of the files you edited come up as conflicted (in red in the list), you will need to merge them by hand in the tool provided when you double-click on the list item.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a patch</strong> - This is easy.  Right-click on the wordpress root folder and select <em>Tortoise SVN - Create Patch</em>.  A dialog appears to allow you to select the files you want to include in the patch.  Check the files you want to include, then save the patch file.  If I&#8217;m patching one file, I&#8217;ll usually use the full name of the file followed by &#8220;.diff&#8221;, for example, &#8220;admin-functions.php.diff&#8221;.</li>\n<li><strong>Find a Trac Ticket</strong> - To submit a patch, you need a ticket.  Be sure to search for an existing ticket for your issue before creating a new ticket.  If one doesn&#8217;t exist, create one and explain the problem as clearly as possible.  When you have a ticket, click <em>Attach File</em> and attach your patch file.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>That&#8217;s pretty much it, even though I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve left some trivial things out.</p>\n<p>The essential bit to recognize is that there really isn&#8217;t a good excuse for a developer to know enough to make code changes but not enough to use source control.  If you don&#8217;t know source control, consider that learning this simple task is a great way to pad your resume.

They are things that you&#8217;re not going to notice unless you are developer.

On with the new features list, which is by no means comprehensive:<br />\n<a id="more-2135"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>More Abstracted Data Layer</strong> - The core WordPress code has been refactored to abstract direct calls to the database when adding posts, comments, and other data.  This will lead to improvements in database access (perhaps even supporting other database engines in the future) and plugin development, including&#8230;</li>\n<li><strong>New Import System</strong> - The new import system leverages the abstraction done at the data layer, so that import routines can call simple functions to convert posts from other blogging tools instead of a huge complicated series of queries.  Importers are also available directly from the admin, so no special process need be taken to employ them.  (Thanks, <a href="http://lair.fierydragon.org">tinster</a>.)</li>\n<li><strong>Admin Redesign</strong> - It&#8217;s not so significant as the Tiger Admin plugin, but there are a few more gadgets in the admin, especially on the Write page.  You can now drag sections of the page to reorganize them, and click the plus/minus to expand/contract the sections.</li>\n<li><strong>The Rich Editor</strong> - WordPress has a new post editor built in that lets you see what you&#8217;re going to get without having to decipher tags.  You can also resize the editing area on the fly by dragging it, which is pretty cool.  Not everyone who has tried it likes the WYSIWYG editor, so there is an option to disable it on a per-user basis.</li>\n<li><strong>Image/File Uploading</strong> - Just under the Rich Editor in the Write panel, there is a new control that allows you to upload and insert images into your posts.  WordPress keeps track of these images and can even automatically provide dedicated pages to receive comments for them.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Post Preview</strong> - Instead of displaying the post as plain text below the editor, the post is now displayed in an embedded frame, using all of the layout and CSS that is normally applied to your site.  In effect, the post looks <em>exactly</em> like it will when you publish it, giving you ample opportunity to review the post&#8217;s layout.</li>\n<li><strong>User Metadata</strong> - To support user-based options, the user data now sports a much more flexible structure.  People who use WordPress as a CMS can now use code to add custom data of any kind to any user profile.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles and Capabilities</strong> - The &#8220;user level&#8221; concept of security has now been replaced with Roles.  WordPress associates a Role to each user. Roles have Capabilities such as &#8220;edit posts&#8221; and &#8220;activate plugins&#8221; that allow certain actions.  There is no more concept of hierarchical users, but plugin authors can now create whole new Capabilities to apply proper permission management.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation Page Changes</strong> - WordPress 1.5 lets you switch themes, and 2.0 shows you what they look like before you do it.  If a theme includes a screenshot, you&#8217;ll see it in the Presentation admin panel to help you choose the theme for your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax Category Addition</strong> - There&#8217;s a bunch of ajax in WordPress 2.0 and this is probably the most requested use of it.  This feature lets you add new categories directly from the post-writing page.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax List Management</strong> - There are a few places in the admin that show lists of things and let you delete, like categories, posts, comments.  Now, instead of reloading, the row turns red and then fades out.</li>\n<li><strong>Moved Javascript/Images</strong> - Version 2.0 uses a lot more javascript than prior versions.  Some utilities, like <a href="http://www.axentric.com/posts/default/7">FAT</a> (Fade Anything Technique) and <a href="http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/">SACK</a> (Simple Ajax Code Kit), can be used by other tools and plugins, so it&#8217;s good to put them someplace where developers know they will reside, and outside of the admin directory, which might have weird permissions.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Admin Pages</strong> - The guys who worked on <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2/">K2</a> went to some lengths to hack a custom configuration page for their theme into the WordPress admin.  Now that capability is easily available by including a functions.php file with the theme.  You can see this at work in the new header generator for the Default theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Ping Delay Removed</strong> - Rather than pinging trackbacks and pingbacks when the post is saved (this causes the delay you see when posting to WP1.5), the pings are attempted via a different method that allows the admin interface to respond more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Persistent Cache</strong> - There are certain types of queries that WordPress makes to the database repeatedly.  To speed things up, the results of these queries are cached to disk.  This caching is still compatible with other caching plugins, like WP-Cache, and could be just enough of a boost for larger sites to avoid optimizing everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Database Versioning</strong> - Now when updates are made to the database schema, your admin panel will tell you to run the upgrade routines.  This is handy because it keeps your database fresh enough to support the code that runs on it.</li>\n<li><strong>New Built-In Plugins</strong> - WordPress 2.0 is now packed with the Akismet plugin for comment spam prevention, and the WP-DB-Backup plugin for manual or automated database backups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the major features added since 1.5.2 was released on August 20th.  In addition to these major items (did I forget anything, anyone?) a few hundred bug fixes have been applied.  I did not count them to know the specific number, but there were a lot.  If you have a favorite bug that you wanted squashed, you should head over to <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org">the bug database</a> and search for it.  If you don&#8217;t find your bug, <em>add it</em>.

WordPress keeps track of these images and can even automatically provide dedicated pages to receive comments for them.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Post Preview</strong> - Instead of displaying the post as plain text below the editor, the post is now displayed in an embedded frame, using all of the layout and CSS that is normally applied to your site.  In effect, the post looks <em>exactly</em> like it will when you publish it, giving you ample opportunity to review the post&#8217;s layout.</li>\n<li><strong>User Metadata</strong> - To support user-based options, the user data now sports a much more flexible structure.  People who use WordPress as a CMS can now use code to add custom data of any kind to any user profile.</li>\n<li><strong>User Roles and Capabilities</strong> - The &#8220;user level&#8221; concept of security has now been replaced with Roles.  WordPress associates a Role to each user. Roles have Capabilities such as &#8220;edit posts&#8221; and &#8220;activate plugins&#8221; that allow certain actions.  There is no more concept of hierarchical users, but plugin authors can now create whole new Capabilities to apply proper permission management.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentation Page Changes</strong> - WordPress 1.5 lets you switch themes, and 2.0 shows you what they look like before you do it.  If a theme includes a screenshot, you&#8217;ll see it in the Presentation admin panel to help you choose the theme for your site.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax Category Addition</strong> - There&#8217;s a bunch of ajax in WordPress 2.0 and this is probably the most requested use of it.  This feature lets you add new categories directly from the post-writing page.</li>\n<li><strong>Ajax List Management</strong> - There are a few places in the admin that show lists of things and let you delete, like categories, posts, comments.  Now, instead of reloading, the row turns red and then fades out.</li>\n<li><strong>Moved Javascript/Images</strong> - Version 2.0 uses a lot more javascript than prior versions.  Some utilities, like <a href="http://www.axentric.com/posts/default/7">FAT</a> (Fade Anything Technique) and <a href="http://twilightuniverse.com/2005/05/sack-of-ajax/">SACK</a> (Simple Ajax Code Kit), can be used by other tools and plugins, so it&#8217;s good to put them someplace where developers know they will reside, and outside of the admin directory, which might have weird permissions.</li>\n<li><strong>Theme Admin Pages</strong> - The guys who worked on <a href="http://binarybonsai.com/wordpress/k2/">K2</a> went to some lengths to hack a custom configuration page for their theme into the WordPress admin.  Now that capability is easily available by including a functions.php file with the theme.  You can see this at work in the new header generator for the Default theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Ping Delay Removed</strong> - Rather than pinging trackbacks and pingbacks when the post is saved (this causes the delay you see when posting to WP1.5), the pings are attempted via a different method that allows the admin interface to respond more quickly.</li>\n<li><strong>Persistent Cache</strong> - There are certain types of queries that WordPress makes to the database repeatedly.  To speed things up, the results of these queries are cached to disk.  This caching is still compatible with other caching plugins, like WP-Cache, and could be just enough of a boost for larger sites to avoid optimizing everything.</li>\n<li><strong>Database Versioning</strong> - Now when updates are made to the database schema, your admin panel will tell you to run the upgrade routines.  This is handy because it keeps your database fresh enough to support the code that runs on it.</li>\n<li><strong>New Built-In Plugins</strong> - WordPress 2.0 is now packed with the Akismet plugin for comment spam prevention, and the WP-DB-Backup plugin for manual or automated database backups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those are the major features added since 1.5.2 was released on August 20th.  In addition to these major items (did I forget anything, anyone?) a few hundred bug fixes have been applied.  I did not count them to know the specific number, but there were a lot.  If you have a favorite bug that you wanted squashed, you should head over to <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org">the bug database</a> and search for it.  If you don&#8217;t find your bug, <em>add it</em>.  (Use your WordPress support forum login for the bug database - It&#8217;s easy!)\n</p>\n<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/asymptomatic/wp?g=10" />";}i:22;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:50:"Weblog Tools Collection: Wordpress Meetup in India";s:4:"guid";s:79:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2006/01/20/wordpress-meetup-in-india/";s:4:"link";s:60:"http://feeds.feedburner.com/weblogtoolscollection/UXMP?m=581";s:11:"description";s:1117:"<p>It looks like I am going to be at Calcutta, India for two weeks around the end of February and would like to get together with Wordpress and blogging folks from that region.</p>\n	<p>March 4th (Saturday) is the tentative date for the meetup and my initial thoughts are to meet at the Park Hotel (on Park Street).

I had come down on two systems - <strong>MovableType</strong> and <strong>WordPress</strong>.\r\n\r\nBoth of these are well-known and the most popular blog types. They both had really attractive features, yet differentiated themselves with tools that I had never experienced. After trying both, by which I mean installing, skinning, testing, and posting, I finally decided to go with <em>WordPress</em>.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nHere''s a more specific comparison:\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Out look</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>I was not impressed with either of the two default looks. The internal coding (html and css) are both really organized; however, the design was not the bee''s knees. If I had to choose a default skin, I''d have chosen <em>WordPress</em> (<a href="http://demo.opensourcecms.com/wordpress/">Sample</a>). However, since I was going to skin this blog myself anyway, this didn''t matter much.</dd>\r\n</dl><dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Functionality</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>I was overwhelmed by the number of options and functions that <em>MovableType </em>had. Although WordPress is still ahead of most blogs, MT has really outpowered WP with its direct outputs.</dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Skinning</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>This feature was probably the one of the most important that I was looking for. Without any doubt, MT certainly has a more organized internal skinning syntax and organization. Each template is divided into pages where it''s rebuilt after each post. However, after studying WP''s default skin, I found that <em>WordPress''s</em> skinning format is actually more sentimental, quick and painless. WP actually embeds its functions, such as displaying a post, into your page, instead of vice versa. This is more structured as if it''s like a series of functions that can be added to a php page.</dd>\r\n</dl><dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Usability</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>For some reason, MT rebuilds each page according to the template, and makes an archive of it for every post. I find this incredibly disturbing, as each piece of information stored in the database is reproduced to take up more space and bandwidth. This can also be irritating when updating a template. MT will have to rebuild all of the pages again, even if there are a few hundred posts. <em>Wordpress</em>, on the other hand, dynamically pulls data out of the database and disaplays it accordingly. Power to the Press.</dd>\r\n</dl><dl>\r\n<dt><strong>Personal Taste</strong></dt>\r\n<dd>I was born with PHP, not CGI, which MT uses.

For example, leetspeekers might refer to their computer "5x1llz" (skills).</li>\r\n	<li>Rules of grammar are rarely obeyed. Many leetspeekers will capitalize every letter except for vowels (LiKe THiS) and otherwise reject conventional English style and grammar.</li>\r\n	<li>Mistakes are often uncorrected. Common typing misspellings (or typos) such as "teh" instead of "the" are left uncorrected and may be adopted to replace the correct spelling.</li>\r\n	<li>Non-alphanumeric characters may be combined to form letters. For example, using slashes to create "//" can substitute for the letter M, and two pipes combined with a hyphen to form "|-|" is often used in place of the letter H.

Nonetheless, it will have many more interesting features, obviously related to the matrix.\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/agent_smith.jpg" alt="" class="right" />\r\nImagine people as Agent Smiths turning others into Smiths. There will be agents (neutral) that will come in and screw things up.

Funny how I didn''t expect much from today, but something very obscure pleased me.\r\n\r\nIt was the Physics Olympics Competition of UBC today. After I got there at 8:30 in the morning (to sign up, when the actual thing starts at 9:30), I found no one in my team there. I went back to Transition and saw all of them there making hovercrafts and mechnical timer. These two were part of the competition that could be made before-hand.\r\n\r\nThe hovercraft did not turn out as great (or even satisfactory) as I thought. First of all, it did not work at all. It''s supposed to be a piece of board with a computer fan on top blowing air to the bottom, which is an air-filled bag thing that has holes on the bottom to push the thing up. There will be a huge fan behind the hovercraft to move it horizontally. And ours, well, wasn''t what was expected. It had a balloon bag thing on the bottom the size of a Chinese mouse pad, it didn''t float at all. Not at all.\r\n\r\nSo we kind of expected despair when we got to the hovercraft session. Despair was what we deserved, but not what we got. We were making jokes about how crappy and sad our hovercraft is, and half joking that the load on top of the hovercraft (which gives more points) can be the 20kg battery that sustains the computer fan. And that''s when the thought came through. Even though it didn''t work half as well as we joked it would be, it was funny to watch the judges faces twist like their hands were stapled to our fan. The score is calculated by 2BML/T. B is equal to 4 if our battery for the fan is self sustaining (not have to be carried manually). M is the mass of the load (our gigantic battery). L is the length in which the hovercraft moves. And T is the time it takes. So finding out that M is calculated in grams, we realized that the 20kg battery will be 20,000 x our points. Most people had 40 points. If we moved our hovercraft by 0.01 meters (1 centimeter), we''d get like 200 points and win it. But nooo, it didn''t move.\r\n\r\nI didn''t see the mech timer. TOo busy watching Jeff pwn with RPG on my paid Inf account.\r\n\r\nAnd after coming back to Trans after the competition finished, we realized our teacher has gone home (or at least left the building). The door was locked. I picked at the lock for half an hour before realizing that the room next door is connected to our room in the ceiling. The ceiling. I went in there, poked out one of the tiles, and jumped into our shaky room, and unlocked it!

The recent revival of Mozilla''s Firefox is crushing I.E. to 70%, a point that it''s never been at, even when Netscape was still known to mankind. So these alternatives are supposedly good at everything.\r\n\r\nHere is a description of the current big browsers out there. Since most users use Windows, I''ll only list the Win browsers. And this excludes all I.E. rendering engine based browsers (including Maxthon, CrazyBrowser etc). <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">Current browser stats</a>.\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n<dt><a href="http://www.mozilla.org"><strong>Firefox / Mozilla</strong></a></dt>\r\n<dd><p>I have nothing against open source, mozilla, or its name. But I don''t like it. It''s still a very young application and needs way more development than it currently gets. Firefox''s main developer just left for Google. Now the browser is left with a bunch of contributors who can''t really do much.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the tabs, however, not its stability. It crashes very often (for me at least). It''s interface is, quite, ugly. If there are more than 5 tabs open within a window, the browser crashes. It sounds like that <a href="http://www.happynowhere.net/mac_parody.php">mac video</a>, but it''s true.

First of all, I have to say Opera''s usability is absolutely awesome. The basic customization of the working environment is so delicate. You can have your browser work in anyway you want. Second, its speed of loading any page is faster than all other browsers. Some heavy-graphics pages load significantly faster. The current version of Opera is at 7.5 - you can see how this program has evolved. There are so many options that I can play with. Right now, I can close this window (with 4 tabs) and this textarea (with this text inside), and after I re-open Opera, all of the data will still be here. All sessions are saved automatically, even as it crashes. Opera works fine even if there are 30 tabs open. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only thing that''s not quite right about it is that it has text-ads, for free-version that is. Mine are gone. Without the ads, Opera is like a browser God. This revenue is probably the only thing that''s keeping Opera alive. Opera 8 (beta) is already out. It does, however, have a few mis-interpretations for some standard html/css tags. This also applies for the current Opera browser (7.5). <em>Some</em>, not all, web pages are displayed with a Seinfeld funny tone - awkwardness. Only because there few smart people realizing that Opera is good and use it, the little percentage of users make designers/coders ignore Opera users. I guess I can blame natural-born retards for that.</p></dd>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nIn general, Opera pwns Firefox, IE, and all other browsers in all ways - up, down and sideways. \r\n', 'Too Many Browsers', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'too-many-browsers', '', '', '2005-03-07 19:29:31', '2005-03-08 03:29:31', '', 0, '/notepad/2005/03/07/too-many-browsers/', 0, '', '', 6),

There are <em>everything</em>, including all the inappropriete stuff to post on a personal site.

Gmail imports contacts. <strong>Gmail can''t export contacts.</strong>\r\n\r\nWhat reason would there be for Gmail to export contacts? No one who starts using Gmail will switch back to the puny hotmail or yahoomail. So why export your contact list? I decided to try out <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunbird</a>, an email client program, and it''s awesome! The interface and functionality (including Gmail''s threaded email!) are widely customizable. I strongly suggest you try it out. \r\n\r\nBut when composing email, it kills my brain cells to try to remember everyone''s email address. I just love how in Gmail, you can type "Some guy" and the email addresses pop up. This works too, in Thunbird, except I don''t have my contacts in there.\r\n\r\nAfter searching around with no solution, I came up with my own. This is what I wasted 2 hours of my life on.\r\n\r\n<strong>Select all your contacts, copy them, and paste them into a text-editor</strong>\r\n\r\nGo to your contact list. It should look something like this.\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gmailexportcontacts.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nClick All Contacts, as you want to export all of them.\r\n\r\nSelect them: drag your mouse from the beginning of the first contact to the last contact. Careful not to click on them. Gmail would then take you to the specific contact.\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gmailexportselect.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nCopy those text, and paste them into a text-editor (notepad would be fine). Right now, each contact should be on a separate line, regardless of some blank spaces.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Hard Part: Formatting</strong>\r\n\r\nThis is probably the hardest part of all. If you have a few contacts (less than 20) and wouldn''t mind wasting a few minutes selecting and deleting, do the following, and skip to the next bold section:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Delete all the white spaces before and after each contact. There should be a tab ("n") in front of the names, and a tab after the email address. Delete all of them. Show no mercy. Then save the file.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIf you are like me who has more than 100 contacts and is as lazy as you can get, you might want to do this. This involves some technological terms and software. ''Regex'' is needed here. Don''t worry about what it means, all you need is a text-editor that supports it. Neither Notepad nor Microsoft Word supports this. <a href="http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/">Notepad++</a>, a free-source software, does (Dreamweaver works as well). Notepad++ is really useful, and will come handy in the future too. \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><p>Now with a regex editor, paste what you copied (your contacts) into a new file. Click the Replace button (in Notepad++, it''s Control + H), and enter the following value for the "<strong>Find</strong>" field:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> All textfields used here are only viewable through <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>. Indeed it''s a shame, but neither Firefox nor Opera interprets a proper "tab" in the textfield as a tab. Please view this page with IE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><input type="text" value="	([a-zA-Z0-9.-_]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9-._]+)" size="50" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you accidentally change something in there, refresh the page and copy it again. Notice there is a tab in front of all that crap.</p></li>\r\n\r\n	<li><p>Enter this for the <strong>Replace</strong> field:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><input type="text" value=" $1@$2" size="50" /></p>\r\n<p>There is a space in front of that. If you don''t see one, put your curser around the dollar sign and use the arrow keys to move left and right to see if there is a space character. If not, put a space in front of it all.</p></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Check "Regular Expression"</strong>. <strong>Click Replace All</strong>. Now all the tabs in front of the email addresses should now be spaces.</li>\r\n	<li><p>Now we are going to delete all the tabs (we couldn''t do that before, as that would delete the tab between the name and the email address). Enter this for the <strong>Find</strong> field (it may seem like there is nothing, but select it and you will see a tab):</p>\r\n\r\n<p><input type="text" value="	" size="50" /></p></li>\r\n\r\n<li><p>Enter <em>nothing</em> for the <strong>Replace</strong> field. This is crucial. Delete any character or spaces that''s there.</p></li>\r\n\r\n	<li><p>Technically, we could stop here and move on, but since people have last names, the program won''t distinguish the last name from the email address, since some contacts may or may not have last names. Enter this for the <strong>Find</strong> field:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><input type="text" value=" ([a-zA-Z0-9.-_]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9-._]+)" size="50" /></p></li>\r\n\r\n<li><p>Enter this for the <strong>Replace</strong> field:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><input type="text" value="	([a-zA-Z0-9.-_]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9-._]+)" size="50" /></p></li>\r\n\r\n<li><p>Make sure Regular Expression is still checked. <strong>Click Replace All</strong></p></li>\r\n\r\nNow save this file as a text document (*.txt) somewhere.\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>The Final Touch</strong>\r\n\r\nThis last part only applies for Thunderbird. Of course, you can do the similar for Microsoft Outlook and so on. It should generally work for all email clients.\r\n\r\nIn Thunderbird, click the Addressbook button, then Tools -> Import. Choose Addressbook, click Next. Choose "Text file (LDIF, .tab, .csv, .txt)" and click Next. Now find your text file of your contacts (You might want to select All Types for File Types to find a .txt file). Now you see a similar dialog.\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/gmailexportthunderbird.jpg" alt="" />\r\n\r\nMove the Display Name up to the first row (select Display name, and click Move Up). Move the Primary Email to the second row. Click OK, and you are done!\r\n\r\nYou can now send emails by just typing the contact name when composing.

It didn''t lag (too much) and had a relatively simple interface that crappy computers could handle. V6 was crap. Microsoft had to implement such a heavy-graphic interface. My old computer was begging me to uninstall it. Ok, so MSN Messenger 7 beta came out. Not much difference, except for more graphics. The thing is, graphics are nice. After someone uses the program for more than a month, the graphics become boring and retarded.. which brings a whole business of downloading skins and lah.\r\n\r\nA couple of days ago, the official version 7 of MSN Messenger was released. I have to say it''s crappier than I thought.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Main Window</strong>\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/crappymsn.gif" alt="" />\r\n\r\nAll the rectangles with red tints indicate the parts of the program written by the programmers when they were temporarily retarded. What the hell is a "personal message"? We already have a Screen Name. Personal Messages won''t be so personal, since everyone sees it anyway. What''s the point of that? To take up more space and make the program bigger so dial up users can poke their eye balls out while waiting for the installations.\r\n\r\nI, for one, do not use MSN Space or MSN Today (the main MSN website). But I can''t blame Mr. Gates for implementing these crap buttons into an already lame program (that everyone uses). They have to find some way to falsely fool users into a site that no one uses. Right?\r\n\r\nAnd regarding the MSN Space thing, I''ve realized that many contacts on my MSN contact list have one. Not all, but many. And I guess this is common for everyone - everyone''s "blog" has about one or two entry, dated back to a couple of months ago. And why does the annoying yellow star still blink beside your green msn guy even if it''s not updated? Because Microsoft wants more hits for their "MSN Space Association of the Stupidest and Most Useless Blog Apprentice" site.\r\n\r\nI haven''t noticed the Search bar on the bottom of the screen since the new installation. I remember seeing it in previous versions of MSN Messenger. Now the ad is probably bigger, that''s why I see more crap beside it.\r\n\r\nBy the way, anyone know how to get rid of the ads with MsgPlus? I can''t find the option.\r\n\r\n<strong>Chat Window</strong>\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/crappymsn2.gif" alt="" />\r\n\r\nBefore I forget, I have to mention the lamest thing about MSN Messenger. It freezes. All the time, for many unimaginable reasons. You join a 2+ people chat. The window freezes. You try to login after being disconnected because you took a bite of an apple, it freezes. You see someone leave a chat, it freezes. You try to sign off, but someone talks to you because the MSN server is incredibly slow, it freezes. You change the option of not displaying your display pic because it''ll freeze, it freezes..\r\n\r\nThe Games button currently doesn''t work. And it annoys me so much not remembering it doesn''t work, and clicking it only to have it stuck on top of the window for eternity until you realize you can manually shut down MSN Messenger through Task manager.\r\n\r\nSeriously, what are the winks / packs / nudge for? Winks = smileys, except you have to download the latest version of Flash player and have it go on forever. Packs = .. !? Something that rich bastards would pay for I guess. And the nudge. The sound, and sudden movement of the window scare the crap out of me and make me so pissed at whoever did it. And also, add it to the freeze list. My old computer couldn''t take the nudge, so I had to uninstall MSN Messenger 7 and reinstall the 6th. \r\n\r\nWHAT THE HELL IS THE SEARCH BUTTON FOR? We all know how to use an internet messenger program, maybe we might know how to go to www.google.com as well? Guess those MS programmers haven''t thought of that. It has to be so gigantic and has to be right below the send button. It just has to take up 200% of my screen and return weird results from the so called MSN website that I never use. This has got to be the worst feature Microsoft has ever invented for a messenger. I could piss on a dead cow and get a better messenger than that.\r\n\r\nAnd I''m not sure what that pen icon is, beside the A. I installed MsgPlus right after I installed MSN Messenger 7, afraid that it''d take over my computer if I don''t get some protection first. Anyway, if it''s from MsgPlus, skip this part. If not, I have to say it''s the second most retarded thing Microsoft can make. Knowing that I don''t have a tablet, the messenger still puts that icon there, assuming that I know what a tablet is (some might not) and reminding me to buy a tablet. Microsoft doesn''t even make tablets, where does Bill get the profit from that?\r\n\r\n<strong>Freeze</strong>\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/crappymsn3.gif" alt="" />\r\n\r\nA friend sent me this.

In the MSN help documentation, somewhere there should be the notice "This program sucks entirely, don''t use it. If you choose to, well, go ahead, cause we want you to. If you do, please say good things about it, even though it really really sucks." Nuh-uh.\r\n\r\nAnd you see, there are 273 email messages unchecked. Why? Because Hotmail sucks as much as MSN Messenger. As lame as it''ll get. A segway into something more serious, but necessary.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hotmail</strong>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Owns all the intellectual properties of your email messages, attachments, and contacts.

Essentially, it''s another toolbar, placed on the side of your screen. It is not as customizable, but it has more functions. It includes a clock, memo, and a few simple tasks. It is only visible when no windows are maximized, showing the desktop.\r\n\r\n<h4>Misc.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe boot screen can be changed to the Longhorn boot screen look. The login screen can also be customized. \r\n\r\nI am generally pretty happy about the look and effects of Longhorn. Most of these themes are not yet applicable, in my opinion. Some have black background and black text, which can be very annoying. I am currently using the Royale Glass theme, which adds rather a nice tone to my Windows XP.\r\n\r\n<h3>Technical Information</h3>\r\n\r\nI can''t say that the installation was a hustle, but it wasn''t as easy as double clicking an icon. It is recommanded that you restart your system in Safe Mode. This can be done by pressing F8 just before the Windows XP boot screen comes on. I had a lot of trouble with this, as Asus (my motherboard) chooses to uses F8 as a shortcut key for setup. In total, it takes about 5-10min to customize the looks you want and to copy and register the files. \r\n\r\nNothing is free. While this package is free to use, it uses up a lot of your system''s resource. All processes of the system start-up are relatively slower (2-5 seconds more). The entire theme manager uses almost 100MB of virtual memory. It uses a lot of the alpha/transparency effects, which slows down a lot of things. The Sidebar (which I now have disabled) uses up a lot of CPU and memory. It has a partial transparency. Even though you can customize this, it is still pretty laggy, as it''s just another plugin for the desktop.\r\n\r\n<h3>Download</h3>\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the transformation pack is <a href="http://fileforum.betanews.com/detail/Longhorn_Transformation_Pack/1104164392/1">available for download</a>.\r\n\r\nI''d like to say good job to the pack developers.

If the <code>onFocus</code> event handler attached to an anchor link calls a Javascript function that changes the <code>window.location.href</code>, the browser will first call that function and then go to the link in that anchor.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n<pre><code>&lt;script language=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;\r\nfunction gotoSite(url) {\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.location.href = this.url;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true;\r\n}\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;http://mtsix.com&quot;\r\nonFocus=&quot;return gotoSite(''http://google.com'');&quot;&gt;Free Water&lt;/a&gt;\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nThat would make the browser first make an HTTP request to <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>, and then to mtsix.com. What this means is that you could deliberately plant a tracking device for every out going link. Although it means the sacrafice of a non-valid XHTML page because of the event handler, it can be very useful.\r\n\r\nI have implimented this method in the new banner of this site. If you don''t see the <a href="http://mediatemple.net">Media Temple</a> logo on the top right corner, please refresh this page. Then click that logo. There is now an outgoing tracker that I''ve set on that link. For every referer to (mt), the counter attached to that Javascript will increase. Take a look at the code if interested.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the <strong>advantages</strong> to this are\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Being able to notify yourself when an outgoing link is clicked</li>\r\n	<li>Looking and working normally even if Javascript isn''t enabled</li>\r\n	<li>And being search engine friendly. The crawlers will still visit the link (unless rel="nofollow"), but not necessarily the requested page by Javascript</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nTo every solution there are always <strong>disadvantages</strong>: \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>It''s Javascript -- it will only work if the viewer''s browser has Javascript enabled</li>\r\n	<li><del>It will mess up a nicely coded XHTML page with the insertion of the <code>onFocus</code> event handler</del> -- Not if the function is assigned <a href="/notepad/2005/06/23/additional-http-request-to-a-link/#comment-474">inside the Javascript</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIt''s always possible to make a script that redirect outgoing links, such as <code>outgoing.php?link=http://google.com</code>. Personally, I''ve never liked those. I don''t know what the script is actually doing (maybe I''m just paranoid). Some of them may actually be <code>outgoing.php?linkID=4</code>, which always puts me in doubt where I''m redirected to. It''s also bad for the stats of the redirected page. In the example above, Google would be unable to track which exact page the viewer came from, but only the <code>outgoing.php</code>, which isn''t very helpful for either parties.\r\n\r\n', 'Additional HTTP Request To A Link', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'additional-http-request-to-a-link', '', '', '2005-06-24 15:33:42', '2005-06-24 23:33:42', '', 0, '/notepad/2005/06/23/additional-http-request-to-a-link/', 0, '', '', 6),
(139, 1, '2005-08-22 11:18:42', '2005-08-22 19:18:42', 'I''m currently using a PC running Windows, thinking about either purchasing a Mac iBook or installing Linux on this computer. These three major operating systems for consumers have different intended audience. I thought about how each OS is different in terms of learning to use it to the max. Here it is.\r\n\r\n<h4>Microsoft Windows XP</h4>\r\n\r\nAs the most popular consumer operating system, Windows XP makes it easy for anyone to use a computer and access simple data. Its learning curve:\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/windowslearningcurve.gif" alt="" />\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, a user can grab a mouse and start clicking any file and start editting the documents they want. While Windows can do more, problems occur. When this happens, the user (sometimes) sees the blue screen of death. Unless s/he gets a tech support to fix whatever that''s broken, the computer is useless. So as time passes on, the user doesn''t learn much about the real deal with Windows. After the user has been frustrated with the errors for a couple of months or years, the will of wanting to fix the problems grows. Then comes all the DOS, Network, and Registry stuff that the user has to learn about before knowing that s/he is being brainwashed by Microsoft by using MSN Messenger, Internet Explorer, and all that other default applications that come pre-installed with Windows.\r\n\r\nWhen a user gets to this level of realization, the thought of alternative applications and even operating systems come into place.\r\n\r\n<h4>Apple Macintosh</h4>\r\n\r\nEven though I don''t own a Mac, I''ve had experience with them, as well as other Apple products (iTunes). The learning curve of apple products:\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/maclearningcurve.gif" alt="" />\r\n\r\nApple claims Mac OS X as the "most advanced operating system in the world." It attracts users with its slick interface and jelly-like buttons. Macs are powerful to the extent that many things don''t need to be customized to work, thus giving users a easy step up. However, since most of us are brainwashed by Windows, new Mac users aren''t familiar with its style and usage. Therefore, they once again learn about a whole new world of OS. The result is that the average Mac user is very familiar with the OS.\r\n\r\nHowever, after a while, they realize that something isn''t right. They find that Macs can''t do some things, either limited by the fact that Macs are unsupported by some programs or Macs simply can''t be that compatible. Users once again try to learn, but fail because really, there is not much to learn anymore. That hump in the middle of the learning curve indicates this pro-wanna-be behaviour. Macs are too enclosed. After that, disappointed and discouraged users don''t see much improvement in their favourite OS and don''t learn much either.\r\n\r\n<h4>Linux</h4>\r\n\r\nDay to day people (non technical people) haven''t even heard about Linux or Unix. Once the frustration of using a crappy computer forces them to look for <em>reliable</em> alternatives, they come to Linux. At this point, the user''s computer knowledge is up to the point that s/he knows about Open Source and the popular trends on the Internet (ie. blogging). The Linux learning curve:\r\n\r\n<img src="/wp-content/uploads/linuxlearningcurve.gif" alt="" />\r\n\r\nIt requires a lot to start with a *nix system. Knowing the kernal and core applications takes time. Just installing Linux on a PC will teach the user a lot about the system. The user will learn about how a computer works -- hardware and software. S/he sees code, programming languages, packages, and compilers. By then, the word <em>geek</em> comes naturally when applied to the user.', 'Windows, Mac, and Linux Learning Curves', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'windows-mac-and-linux-learning-curves', '', '', '2005-08-22 11:19:43', '2005-08-22 19:19:43', '', 0, '/notepad/2005/08/22/windows-mac-and-linux-learning-curves/', 0, '', '', 9),

Open <code>functions.php</code> from the Shortstat package. Go to line 438, and edit the variable <code>$query</code> so that it becomes\r\n\r\n<pre><code>$query = "SELECT user_agent, COUNT(*) AS ''total'' \r\nFROM $SI_tables[stats]\r\nGROUP BY user_agent\r\nORDER BY total DESC";\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nSave it.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2: Upload Shortstat and install it</h3>\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions in <code>_READ_ME.txt</code>.\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 3: Include Shortstat into your feeds</h3>\r\n\r\nSince your feed is a php file, you can include the <code>inc.stats.php</code> file into your feeds.

(156, 1, '2005-10-11 17:46:52', '2005-10-12 01:46:52', 'Music production isn''t easy. It does however allow the music artist to extend his or her abilities and imagination. Now wouldn''t it be great if you could produce your own tracks? How? Here it is.\r\n\r\nLet me make a note first -- music production here refers to the collective sounds put together to form a song. Each track you hear on a CD or an AAC or MP3 audio file is the final product of the process of music production. We will first explain how this is done generally, then move on to the specifics.\r\n\r\n<h3>Music Production</h3>\r\n\r\nWonder how your favourite artists put together some of the greatest songs you''ve heard? Most medium and large artists sing the songs and need to work with a production team to produce the actual song (the combination of drums, guitars, etc). Nowadays (within the last five years), most of the production work is done digitally for better sound quality and faster development.\r\n\r\nAssuming you write your own music (either instrumental or vocal), here are three things to achieve the effects you wish to create.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Individual sounds that you need for your tracks</li>\r\n	<li>Software (and hardware if you want) to put those sounds together</li>\r\n	<li>A mic to record vocals if needed (this would also require software support)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Specifics</h3>\r\n\r\nWe''ll first talk about that software that does it all. There are many programs out there that emphasize on different aspects of music production. Not one of them is perfect for everything. These are a few popular ones.\r\n\r\n<h4>Software: Production</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sony Media Software -- <a href="http://www.sonymediasoftware.com/Products/ShowProduct.asp?PID=928">ACID Pro</a> (299.96 USD)</li>\r\n	<li>Ableton -- <a href="http://www.ableton.com/index.php?main=live">Live</a> ($499.00 USD)</li>\r\n	<li>Image-Line Software -- <a href="http://www.fruityloops.com/">FL Studio</a> ($149)</li>\r\n	<li>Digidesign -- <a href="http://www.digidesign.com/products/le/">Pro Tools LE</a></li>\r\n	<li>Propellerhead Software -- <a href="http://www.propellerheads.se/">Reason</a> ($499)</li>\r\n	<li>Apple -- <a href="http://www.apple.com/logicpro/">Logic Pro</a> Mac only ($999)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<em>Note: These prices represent the cost of the most advanced version of the software. There maybe simpler editions for beginners, but the emphasis here is on the functionality.</em>\r\n\r\nThese programs do almost the same thing. They contain mixers (putting sounds together), step-sequencers (enabling MIDI inputs), and all the other jazz that should get you ready for your first song. Of course, it''s a personal preference to which one you really like (and the list is not limited to those programs only). It takes time getting used to one program and creating a song.\r\n\r\n<h4>Hardware: Production System</h4>\r\n\r\nLike a computer, music production might require a central processing unit. A popular prefered choice is the <a href="http://www.digidesign.com/">Mbox</a>. It allows you to connect all controllers, keyboards, guitars, and other (digital) instruments to one unit with pre-processing before transfering data to your computer.\r\n\r\n<h4>Hardware: MIDI Keyboards</h4>\r\n\r\nTo make sure you have the right notes, a MIDI keyboard might be involved. This is not necessary as many production software now include step sequencers that you can put notes into; but it is always nice to have an actual keyboard to perform on. A good one would be the <a href="http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/Ozonic-main.html">M-Audio Ozonic</a> keyboard. Great for starters.\r\n\r\n<h4>Hardware: Instrumental Mic</h4>\r\n\r\nTo record your own intruments if you are unhappy with the pre-recorded ones that come with your software, you might like the <a href="http://www.shure.com/microphones/models/ksm109.asp">Shure KSM109</a> mic. Clarity is the key.\r\n\r\n<h4>Hardware: Vocal Mic</h4>\r\n\r\nIf you want to sing, use <a href="http://www.shure.com/microphones/models/ksm27.asp">Shure KSM27</a> mic. No matter how high or low your voice is, this will carry your singing into tune.\r\n\r\n<h4>Hardware: Speakers</h4>\r\n\r\nLastly, speakers for testing your sounds are crucial. Headphones are usually better because they block outside sounds and isolate your music. The <a href="http://www.sonystyle.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/eCS/Store/en/-/USD/SY_BrowseCatalog-Start?CategoryName=pa_PADepartmentAccessories_Headphones_CDSeries%2fStudioMonitor&Dept=audio">Sony Studio Monitors</a> are always good.\r\n\r\nAnd you are good to go! For starters, I recommand downloading the trials of the software and get the gist of what it''s like making music right off the bat. Technically, you can make anything you want with any software alone -- it''s just hard. Some programs might be easier to make certain songs while others aren''t. The new Gorillaz CD was produced with ACID Pro 5 (and other hardware of course). So it''s really your choice which one to use.\r\n\r\n<em>This post was inspired by the <a href="http://forums.ultrashock.com/ff.htm?http://forums.ultrashock.com/forums/showthread.php?s=&threadid=72696&perpage=40&display=&pagenumber=1">thread over at Ultrashock</a>.</em>', 'How to Be Your Own Music Producer', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'open', '', 'how-to-be-your-own-music-producer', '', '', '2005-10-11 17:47:00', '2005-10-12 01:47:00', '', 0, '/notepad/2005/10/11/how-to-be-your-own-music-producer/', 0, '', '', 3),
