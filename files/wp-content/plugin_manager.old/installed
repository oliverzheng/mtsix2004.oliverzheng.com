In addition, flagged commenters are offered the possibility to moderate their own comments by solving <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">Captchas</a>, which makes life easier for both legit commenters and blog owner (less moderation to bother with).<br/>
To sum-up enormously, this plugin addresses the following issues, in order of priority:<br/><ul><li>No deleted false positive (bad bad bad).</li><li>Extremely few moderated false positives (annoying): uses Captcha to keep these at a minimum.</li><li>No published spam.</li><li>very little spam held in moderation (must be destroyed directly: really annoying to have to moderate it).</li>
</ul><br/>Among its many features, it also uses an enhanced version of MT-Blacklist/WP-Blacklist and intelligently helps you keeping your blacklist up-to-date with minimal work...<br/>
Configuration is absolutely automated: if you are using wp-plugin-mgr, you can be running it in just one click, if you download it, make sure you <b>read</b> the instructions (they are short but essential). Once installed, just browse to Options >> Spam Karma, in the wp-admin control panel and Spam Karma will be ready to work.<br/>
<i><b>Important:</b> if you are using Spam Karma with Wordpress 1.3, do not use the standard configuration link at the end of One-Click install. You can access Spam Karma's options by logging in the Admin panel, clicking on Options and picking the "Spam Karma" submenu.
 For users of WP 1.2, you need to browse directly to the the plugin configuration screen, by going to the URL (provided on the Plugins page as a reminder): http://[yourdomain.com]/[yourblog]/wp-content/plugins/spam-karma.php?spamk_setup</i><br/>
<b>Thanks and Acknowledgement</b>:<br/>
<i>Many, many people have contributed, knowingly or not, to this plugin, with their ideas, code, help, testing, advice and support... I ended up rewriting most of the code I took from these plugins, but it nonetheless gave me a solid base to start with quickly. Thanks guys.</i><br/>

I will soon post a list of upcoming features (many, including better blacklist management) for Spam Karma 2.0...
